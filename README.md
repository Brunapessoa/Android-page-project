# Android-page-project

In this project, Iâ€™m applying knowledge acquired in HTML and CSS. It is a simple and responsive webpage that explores the history behind the Android mascot.
The development of this page involved several key concepts:
- Semantic HTML: Proper use of semantic tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.
- CSS Styling: Application of a monochromatic color scheme, focusing on shades of green to ensure visual harmony.
- Custom Font: Integration of an external font using @font-face, applied via a CSS variable.
- Interactivity: Use of pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::after) to enhance user experience.
- Responsive Design: Layout adapts to different screen sizes using flexible containers (max-width, media queries through &lt;picture&gt;, responsive video embedding).
* Extras:
    Styled links and navigation.
    Highlighted sections using gradients and shadows.
    Customized bullet points and content structure.

The purpose of this project is to reinforce practical skills in building structured, aesthetically consistent, and mobile-friendly web pages using only HTML and CSS.

This project was developed based on HTML and CSS classes by Professor Gustavo Guanabara, from the Curso em Video channel on YouTube.
