            <h1>The History of the Android Mascot</h1>
            <p>You probably know that <strong>Android</strong>, the operating system maintained by
                <strong>Google</strong> , is one of the most widely
                used for mobile devices around the world. But did you know that its friendly mascot has a name and a
                very curious story? Follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
            </p>
            <h2>First Version</h2>
            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and was made by a developer named <a
                    href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
                    target="_blank" rel="external">
                    Dan Morrill
                </a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"> Inkscape
                    </a> (a free vector graphics software) and created his own version of a robot. The
                goal was simply to give the system some personality for his team â€” there was no official request from
                the company to create a mascot.</p>

            </picture>
            <p>This bizarre first version was even named in honor of its creator: they were called the
                <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a mascot started to evolve, and the task was handed over to a professional in the
                field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">
                    Irina Blok
                </a>, who also worked at Google, was given the mission of representing the little robot in a more
                appealing way.</p>
            <picture>
                <source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="./imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg" type="image/jpg">
                <source media="(max-width:1050px)" srcset="./imagens/irina-blok.jpg" type="image/jpg">
                <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="irina-img">
            </picture>
            <p>Irina's main idea was to design everything with simple, flat lines. The drawing also needed to be
                instantly recognizable and relatable to anyone who looked at it. That's how <strong>Bugdroid</strong>,
                the new Android mascot, was born.</p>
            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="bugdroid" id="android">
            <p>The main inspiration for <strong>Bugdroid</strong>'s design came from those little figures used on
                restroom doors to indicate gender. Legend has it that Irina was sketching at her desk in the
                <strong>Google</strong> office, glanced toward the bathrooms, and instantly connected the dots: simple,
                clean, and to the point.

                <p>Another fun fact about Android is that each version was named after a dessert, in alphabetical order,
                    from version 1.5 to 9.0:</p>
                <ul type="none">
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>2.0 / 2.1 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lollipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never happened, as Google decided to end this fun naming
                    tradition and switched to numbers, starting with <strong>Android 10</strong>.</p>
